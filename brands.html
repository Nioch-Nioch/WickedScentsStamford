                APOTHEKE
              </h5>
              <p>Founder Chrissy Fichtl’s passion for soap making, scent formulation and essential oils are the roots of
                what created APOTHEKE in 2011. Chrissy learned about the beauty of essential oils, starting with sourcing
                ingredients directly from farms and teaching herself the art of soap making in her own kitchen. Over time,
                she has self taught herself about fragrance blending.
                </br></br>
                In the summer of 2012, APOTHEKE opened their first factory, a 3,000 square foot site in Brooklyn, New
                York. Chrissy’s husband Sebastian Picasso took on the lead as production. He aided in maintaining the
                philosophy that high-quality and luxury goods can still be made steps from home by real people.

                Driven by the desire to give Americans a simple way to join the fight against trafficking, we set out to
                build a candle company that does just that. Since our humble beginnings in 2017, it's been amazing to see
                the impact that we have been able to make together!
                </br> </br>
                Calyan Wax Co. is run by a small (but growing!) team in North Texas. We design, develop, and create every
                candle from scratch with an obsessive dedication to beauty, quality, and performance. The result? Nothing
                but the best candles on the market that we're proud to put our names on.

                Their story began, with a modest supply of essential oils and natural ingredients, in a small garage in Santa Monica. With a view of Catalina, they set out to recreate the unique smells and experiences that were found in other parts of the world. Soon friends, family, and the local community started taking notice of what was coming out of that little garage and their company – inspired and named for the island in the distance, was created. Twenty years later, they have long outgrown that garage, but the essential oils and botanical-based ingredients, which were so important to them in the beginning, are still at the heart of our their story.
              </br></br>
              Relax, draw a bath, and take in a simple moment—and experience The Art of Living Well.
